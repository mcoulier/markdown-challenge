###A funny story
A couple of years ago I was on vacation in France with my friends. After having a little BBQ on the beach, we decided to clean up and move on. While we were moving the BBQ, I suddenly started to feel a rising pain in my left foot. It's apparently not that smart to stand in the exact spot a BBQ had been cooking for a couple of hours. While driving around looking for a doctor the pain started getting worse. We were 5 guys on holiday so of course we didn't bring an EHBO-kit. I needed something to cool my foot while we were being directed by multiple doctors to go to a hospital. We pulled over and started looking in the trunk for anything to use. One of my friends came with the genius idea of putting my foot in an unused garbage bag and filling it with stuff to cool down. We were in a remote area and the hospital was not that close s
#####TL;DR
Don't step in hot sand.
